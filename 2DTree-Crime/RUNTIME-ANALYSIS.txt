 * A note on the complexity of runtime analysis:
 * 
 * Runtime analysis on K-D Trees is challenging in the average case, but not so much in the best and worst cases. 
 * Worst case is easy -- pick the wrong path, and out performance degrades tothat of a linked list. 
 * Similarly, analysis for the best case is trivial, as best case is a balanced tree, and has lg(n) performance.
 * 
 * The average case however, is hard because we need to consider how likely it is for the tree to be balanced or 
 * unbalanced. The chance of the tree being balanced can be improved by picking a "smarter" (closer to the true median) 
 * root of each subtree, such as using a median of three approach. \
